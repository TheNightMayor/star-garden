|       | 1-02    | Fugitive on the Red Planet | 1-4   | Theft cannot be tolerated, especially when the culprit is a former Starfinder! The PCs travel to the red world of Akiton, hot on the heels of a deserting Starfinder who stole a magical relic from the vaults of the Lorespire Complex. Things get complicated when they discover what should be a dreary town in Akiton's wastelands is now positively jubilant. Could this revelry, not to mention the re-opening of town's formerly defunct mining operations, be related to the wayward Starfinder?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 3      |
|       | 1-03    | Yesteryear's Truth         | 1-4   | A Starfinder expedition's dusty data from an orbital scan shows signs of active technology on a distant, war-ravaged planet. Following up on this old lead, the Society dispatches a team of Starfinder to investigate the far-off world. Between making first contact and exploring the ruins of a dead civilization, long-buried secrets of the past are ripe for discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Content in _Yesteryear's Truth_ also contributes to the ongoing goals of the Wayfinders faction.                                                                                                                                                                             | 4      |
|       | 1-04    | Cries from the Drift       | 1-4   | A missing Starfinder ship's distress signal would have gone unnoticed were it not for a passerby detecting it and selling the information to the Society. The PCs are to travel to the crippled starship, and once aboard, reach the bridge in order to piece together the tragic story of the vessel's lost crew. Only by unraveling the mysteries of the drifting starship can the PCs hope to uncover information critical to the Exo-Guardians future operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Content in _Cries From the Drift_ also contributes to the ongoing goals of the Exo-Guardians faction.                                                                                                                                                                        | 4.5    |
|       | 1-07    | The Solar Sortie           | 1-4   | When Historia-7, the leader of the Dataphiles faction, uncovers the first hints of a conspiracy operating against the Starfinder Society, the PCs must assist her in uncovering the truth. Sent to a corporate space station orbiting the Pact Worlds' sun, the PCs must earn favor with the hedonist son of a corporate CEO to gain access to the confidential files Historia-7 needs. However, the PCs are stuck in the middle when this corrupt dilettante's proclivities and shady associations emerge to thwart the Starfinders' covert infiltration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Content in _The Solar Sortie_ also contributes to the ongoing goals of the Dataphiles faction.                                                                                                                                                                               | 3.5    |
|       | 1-09    | Live Exploration Extreme!  | 1-4   | Although the Society was unaware of what existed within the false moon _Salvation's End_ when it obtained exploration rights, Starfinders have since identified a vast, uncharted megacomplex within. The Society's ready to launch its first major expedition into the interior, yet there is one slight complication: in order to fund its initial survey missions, the Society accepted a grant that requires this first mission be televised by an Eoxian reality show. What is already be a momentous mission for the Society is only exacerbated by the mandatory presence of an unliving camera crew—not to mention the interference of the live studio audience in orbit! Can the PCs uncover the secrets of Salvation's End while upholding the Society's publicity deal (perhaps becoming celebrities in the process)? | Content in Live Exploration Extreme! is a continuation of the Starfinder Society special, Starfinder Society \#1–00: Claim to Salvation.                                                                                                                                     | 5      |
|   ✅   | 1-10    | The Half-Alive Streets     | 1-4   | The PCs take part in an investigation after an Absalom Station pawnbroker tries to sell the Starfinder Society a lethal biotech augmentation. The search leads into the depths of the station's Freemarkets and into another investigation initiated by AbadarCorp. With rumors abound of mysterious disappearances near the Freemarkets and that those people using the augmentations are suffering from a mysterious illness, it falls to the PCs to piece together what's going on. Where is this never-before-seen biotech coming from, and what happens when the augmented dead don't stay dead?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 4      |
|       | 1-12    | Ashes of Discovery         | 1-4   | When a major Pact Worlds organization approaches the Starfinder Society about investigating an abandoned outpost in Near Space, the PCs get assigned to the case.

Few are allowed to dig up these sites, yet the Starfinder Society and undead bone sages maintain a joint academic venture known as the Blackmoon Excavation. When Starfinder archaeologists and undead workers begin disappearing from the site the Society sends in a team of agents to uncover why—a secret that resides in the nearby ruins!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 3.5    |

Nothing could possibly go wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | This short Starfinder adventure written by Andrew White can be completed in a single session and includes four 6th-level pregenerated antiheroes whose stories and motivations tie into the plot of the adventure.

If these heroes aren’t careful, they’ll be the next lives claimed in this grim harvest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 4.5    |     |

|       | SB-12   | Under Pressure              |   4   | Illegal gas mining operations are nothing new on the enormous Pact Worlds gas giant Liavara, but mining platform pilot Alana Eledin thought she had a foolproof plan to get past both the mining syndicates and the Confluence Agents’ watchful gaze. She and a crew of desperate fortune seekers would power up a derelict platform they used to work on and take it down into the depths, to the limit of the structure. Of course, no plan is perfect, and reactivating the maneuvering systems on the old rig sent out an alert. Now a Confluence Agent, with Deep Station’s troubles still fresh in mind, has assembled a team of deep pressure specialists along with the PCs to, if possible, rescue the derelict and learn what sent it plunging into the clouds. What no one involved has realized is that there’s a greater danger than the immense pressure facing everyone involved.                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | --     |     |
